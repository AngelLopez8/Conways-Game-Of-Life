# Conways-Game-Of-Life
A C++ Application that visualizes Conway's Game of Life a popular Cellular Automaton.

## Description
Conway's game of life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
The world of the Game of life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead.
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to them.

## Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (as if by underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (as if by overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction)
